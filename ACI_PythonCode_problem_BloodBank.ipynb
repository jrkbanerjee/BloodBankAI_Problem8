    "- **Performance Measure**:\n",
    "  - **Minimize the total travel distance** while ensuring all blood banks are visited exactly once.\n",
    "  - Ensure blood is **delivered to the hospital**.\n",
    "  - **Time Efficiency**, **optimized resource utilization** and **Realiable delivery** are other key performance measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Environment**:\n",
    "  - The region includes **multiple blood banks** and **one hospital**.\n",
    "  - The given environment is **static** and **fully observable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Actuators**:\n",
    "  - Drone's **motors and propellers** to control the flight\n",
    "  - Navigation system of the drone with **gyroscope and accelerometer** to adjust direction and altitude of the drone.\n",
    "  - **Cargo holder** - a safe mechanism to pick up, carry and release the packages. It could be mechanical arms with motors.\n",
    "  - **landing Gear**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensors**:\n",
    "  - **GPS** or other **location-detection systems** to track the drone's position.\n",
    "  - **Lidar** or **Camera** for navigating, obstacle avoidance and measure distances.\n",
    "  - **GSM sensor** in case of cellular communication or other wireless sensors.\n",

    "### **Properties of Task Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Observable (Fully/Partially):**\n",
    "   - **Partially Observable:** The environment is partially observable because the drone might not have complete, real-time information about all variables at all times. For example, weather conditions, traffic (air or ground), or other emergencies may not be fully predictable or observable from the drone's perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deterministic/Stochastic:**\n",
    "   - **Stochastic:** The environment is stochastic as it involves uncertainty and randomness. Factors like weather changes, unforeseen obstacles, or variable traffic conditions can influence the outcomes of the drone's actions, making the environment unpredictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Episodic/Sequential:**\n",
    "   - **Sequential:** The environment is sequential because the droneâ€™s actions are dependent on previous decisions. For instance, choosing a particular blood bank first affects the next available options and the overall route efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Static/Dynamic:**\n",
    "   - **Dynamic:** The environment is dynamic. It changes over time due to external factors such as weather conditions, air traffic, or even changes in the urgency of the blood delivery. The drone must adapt to these changes in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Discrete/Continuous:**\n",
    "   - **Continuous:** The environment is continuous because the drone operates in a real-world space where variables like position, speed, and environmental conditions vary continuously rather than in discrete steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Single-agent/Multi-agent:**\n",
    "   - **Single-agent:** The environment is primarily single-agent concerning the Blood Supply Drone. Although the drone may interact with other agents (like air traffic control), the decision-making process for optimizing the route is focused on a single agent (the drone itself).\n",
